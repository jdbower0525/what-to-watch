To run the program, you must download 100k MovieLens data, unzip it, and then place it
in the same folder as the program to be run.

This program is meant to compile the data from the MovieLens survey and estimate
recommendations to a user based on the user's viewing history.

Included in the program is the capability to ask for average ratings for specific
movies, lists of ratings by either user or movie ID#, and listings of top average
rated movies.
